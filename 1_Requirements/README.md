# INTRODUCTION


Driving can either be one of the most relaxing things to do, or the most stressful. And one of the contributing factors to this is the weather. Sometimes, it gets too hot or too cold that your air conditioning system just doesn’t cut out for you really well. You eventually feel uncomfortable but you have to keep on driving because you’re still so far from your destination. To help people solve this problem, especially on cold nights, car seat heaters were made to help drivers or even passengers enjoy the ride. These car seat heaters help warm you up and keep you toasty on exceptionally cold nights to keep you going and warm. You just need to install them in your car seat, and you’re good to go, all warm and comfortable.
